# Files, Exceptions, and Pickling

## Introduction
In this module, we learn about working with text files, structured error handling, and using markdown language. There are a handful of webpages for reference on pickling and exception handling as well as a review of those webpages. In addition, this document will act as a standard operating procedure for creating both Pickling python code and an Exception Handling python code. In addition, we are also now able to answer a number of questions related to pickling, exception handling, and GitHub webpages and Markdown language.
